Dregex - Deterministic Regular Expression Engine
================================================

Dregex is a Scala/JVM library that implements a regular expression engine using deterministic finite automata (DFA). It supports some Perl-style features and yet retains linear matching time.

Most mainstream engines work with flavors of regular expressions based on the one that appeared Perl 5 in 1994. Those flavors include a wide range of features, which make state-machine based implementation impossible. As they rely on recursive backtracking, these engines can also have exponential matching time.

On the other hand, there is a mathematical definition of regular expressions, as they were invented by Stephen Kleene in 1956. In the most minimalistic version these expresions consist of just literal characters, alternation ("|") and repetition ("*"). They can be matched again arbitrary text of length n in O(n), using a Definite Finite Automaton (DFA). Using DFA also allows to do set operations; i.e., union, intersection and difference.

There are some features of Perl regular expressions that are impossible to express in a DFA, most notable backreferences (i.e., forcing to match the same text more than once). Nevertheless, backreferences are seldom used in practice and it is possible to select a practical subset of the Perl flavor substantially bigger than their mathematical counterpart (or the POSIX's regex) yet expresable using standard DFA.

Dregex is an attempt to implement such a subset and make a fast implementation for the Java Virtual Machine.

Supported regex flavor
----------------------

### Supported features

* Literals
* Escaped characters
* Standard regular language constructs: `|`, `?`, `*` and `+` and parenthesis grouping.
* General quantifiers: `{n}`, `{n,m}`, `{n,}`
* Dot wildcards
* Simple character classes: `[abc]`
* Simple negated character classes: `[^abc]`
* Ranges in character classes: `[a-z]`
* Special character classes: `\w`, `\s`, `\d`.
* Negated special character classes: `\W`, `\S`, `\D`.
* Special character classes inside regular character classes: `[\d\s]`, `[\D]`
* Lookahead (positive and negative), provided they appear at the top level, or as part of a juxtaposition, i.e. they are no allowed inside parenthesis, nested or as members of a conjunction. Additionally the expression before a lookahead must be of fixed length.

### Not (yet) supported

* Lookbehind

### Not supported

* Lookaround in arbitrary positions

Internals
---------

### DFA construction

The library parses the regular expressions and builds a NFA (Nondeterministic Finite Automaton) using a variation of the [Thompson algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thompson%27s_construction_algorithm&oldid=649249684). Then uses the "powerset construction" to build a DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton). One the DFA is built, the matching algorithm is straightforward.

### Wildcards and character classes

Character classes are expanded as disjunctions before NFA creation. Respectively, wildcards are expanded as a universal class. 

Example transformations with alphabet: `abcdefgh`

* `[abc]` → `a|b|c`
* `[^abc]` → `d|e|f|g|h`
* `def[^abc]` → `def(d|e|f|g|h)`
* `.` → `a|b|c|d|e|f|g|h`
* `abc.` → `abc(a|b|c|d|e|f|g|h)`

As the alphabet can be potentially huge (such as Unicode is) something must be done to reduce the number of disjunctions:

* `[abc]` → `a|b|c`
* `[^abc]` → `<other_char>`
* `def[^abc]` → `def(d|e|f|<other_char>)`
* `.` → `<other_char>`
* `abc.` → `abc(a|b|c|<other_char>)`

Where `<other_char>` is a special metacharacter that matches any of the characters of the alphabet not present in the regex. Note that with this technique knowing the whole alphabet explicitly is not needed. Care must be taken when the regex is meant to be used for an operation with another regex (such as intersection or difference). In this case, `<other_char>` must match only the characters present in neither regex. 

#### Example:

Regex space: `[abc]` and `[^cd]`

Characters present in any regex: `abcd`

* `[abc]` → `a|b|c`
* `[^cd]` → `a|b|<other_char>`

### Set operations

Intersections, unions and differences between regex are done using the "product construction". The following pages include graphical explanations of this technique:

* [http://stackoverflow.com/q/7780521/4505326](http://stackoverflow.com/q/7780521/4505326)
* [http://cs.stackexchange.com/a/7108](http://cs.stackexchange.com/a/7108)

This is a relatively straightforward algorithm that is implemented using the already generated DFA.

### Lookahead

In order to support lookaheads, "meta" regular expressions are introduced. A meta regular expression is the intersection or subtraction of 2 other (meta or simple) regular expressions. Lookaround constructions are transformed in equivalent meta simple regular expressions for processing.

* `A(?=B)C` → `AC ∩ AB.*`
* `A(?!B)C` → `AC - AB.*`

In the case of more than one lookaround, the transformation is applied recursively.

This works if `A` is of known length.

Only top level lookarounds that are part of a juxtaposition are permitted, i.e. they are no allowed inside parenthesis, nested or as members of a conjunction. Examples:

Allowed:

* `A(?!B)C`
* `(?!B)C`

Not allowed:

* `(?!B)|B`: part of a conjuction
* `(?!(?!B))`: lookaround inside lookaround
* `(A(?!B))B`: lookaround inside parenthesis
* `A+(?!B)C`: lookaround with variable-length prefix
